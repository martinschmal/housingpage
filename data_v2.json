It\u2019s a bit like living in a student hall of residence because you share social spaces with your peers. But unlike a hall of residence, coliving spaces work to create happy individuals and healthy communities.  Living here, you\u2019ll get to meet people from all over the world. People with different stories, original perspectives, and shared values. You'll make friends, learn surprising lessons, and love the experience.

Interesting bars, bohemian caf\u00e9s and kitsch boutiques dot its most frequented streets like Kastanienallee and Oderberger Stra\u00dfe. It doesn't have the edge that Kreuzberg has, but it's a great place to visit for its laid-back atmosphere.  To get a feel for the local area, head to the Mauerpark.

    "description": "I am moving abroad and looking for somebody to take over my rental contract and furniture for a great 1 bedroom apartment near Bergmannkiez in Kreuzberg. Its a really good location - a 5 minute walk from Hallesches Tor U-Bahn, 10 minutes walk from Bergmannkiez (a super nice area for cafes, restaurants, markets, shops, & bars), and right next to the Landwehr Canal (a great place to hang out in the summer). The abandoned airport - Tempelhofer Feld - is also about a 20minute run away and a great place to jog, cycle, kite landboard or whatever you're into. The apartment has a nice little balony where you can enjoy a meal or drinks in the summer.  The apartment is 37.43 square meters and has the following rooms: A small hallway A kitchen A bathroom A bedroom / living space  I am looking for someone to take as much of the furniture (bed, dining table & chairs, sofa, coffee table, book shelf etc), fittings (curtain rails, lights, coat rack), and electrical items (toaster, iron, kettle, fan etc) as possible. It is all relatively new (1 year max) and in very good condition. A reasonable financial offer for these would be very welcome but I'm happy to give many things away for free. All kitchen fittings and large applicances (oven, washing machine, & fridge-freezer) and all bathroom items are included with the apartment. There is an existing 50mb/s Wi-Fi Internet contract with O2 which is roughly \u20ac30 per month until 22.02.2021 - it would help me out if you can take that over and it will save you the hassle of getting a new router etc (it took them 2 months to deliver and install mine originally).  The warm rent is \u20ac725 per month. A deposit of \u20ac1890 will need to be paid directly to the letting agent. You would need to start the rental contract from 01.03.2020 and it will run until at least 31.07.2020. You can talk directly with the letting agent about the length of contract you desire.  The letting agent requires the following documents: - Mieterselbstauskunft - letter from previous landlord confirming no rental debts - last 3 payslips as proof of income (or a copy of contract stating salary) - healthy credit statement (SCHUFA)  Note also that your salary must be at least 3x times the rental amount.  As I am leaving Berlin on February 28th and the letting agent will take time to vet your documents, we need to move quickly! We can arrange for you to view the apartment this week and if all is good I can recommend you to the letting agent as soon as possible.",

I love my Berlin life\u2026 I do not want to leave and hopefully I can  save my space finding a GOOD, TRUSTING, DECENT QUIET FEMALE but right now, I have a family health emergency and i have to be  away several months, maybe even a year\u2026 and i need someone  who will FIT IN here, hopefully speak german, and not bring too much attention to the fact i have to be away.  Someone who doesnt\u2019 have furniture and someone who doesn\u2019t have an issue with SHARING the space if i need to come back !!  570 a month for a one bedroom, huge 72 qm space in Wedding near SEE STRASSE UBAHN, centrally located.  small bathroom with shower, huge kitchen, and huge living room. There are 2 balconies.  You hear the birds in the morning, and if you want to start a garden on the balcony the landlord would love you!  The person who comes in here has to be easy to communicate with, respectful  of other people, CONSCIOUS, aware, and awake please and WORKING!!  This building is OLD SCHOOL, i.e. people live here for over 20 years, they don\u2019t care as long as there is quiet, and respect for each other\u2019s lives, so no coming in at 3 am, slamming doors etc.   Someone who enjoys the space as a sanctuary to home to, to write, but  no parties. There are so many amazing YOGA spaces round here.  There are green parks here and wonderful walking and Plotzensee is down the road.  This area is NOT highly gentrified and still has a cool  old school german vibe to it.  Speaking German would help not req  So the ROOMMATE situation occurs maybe in jUNE / JULY when i have to come back for a few days or weeks.  I am not sure.  Because of the HEALTH issue I have to go day by day with my family situation!!  I DO NOT KNOW.  You could end up having the space for one year for yourself\u2026 but i know i have to come back june or july just to show myself\u2026. so for a few days. So,this means you will only share for a few weeks!!   I\u2019m a quiet, gay writer, and i would live in the living room, again this is very easy, i usually work nIGHTS, so it would help for the person to work 9-5 so each would have the space to themselves\u2026. the rent would go down to 380 a month\u2026   I\u2019m an older, but still funky dude girl writer!  I like my space to think and write, but I\u2019m also super social and would love to share this space with a curious, but NO DRAMA person who likes her space too, but also likes to hang out with a coffee and chat  here and there\u2026..  Please email me a bit about yourself\u2026 i\u2019ll email photos!! PLEASE PLEASE GET IN TOUCH RIGHT AWAY  thanks and blessings and lets believe in miracles.. cause i sure need one now!",

Close to the M41 bus (350 meters) which covers the Sonnenallee corridor up to Hermannplatz and continues on through Kreuzberg to Potsdamer Platz and Hauptbahnhof. The K\u00f6llnische Heide S-Bahn is 750 meters away, which is easy to get to but far eough away not to be heard in the flat.  I use the 13 sq. m. room in the diagram (attached). There is a small 8 m2 dining room with an antique wooden dining table and chairs. The kitchen is fully equipped, including a clothes washer. The bathroom has a full tub with shower. Hot water is delivered via an electric on-demand water heater. Radiators provide room heating.  There is also the possibility of extending this agreement and/or taking over the lease yourself after my departure. I am preparing to leave Berlin within the year.  Please note that the legal owner (my landlord) will provide you with the paperwork necessary to legally register the flat as your residence in Berlin and that any agreement for extending the lease would be negotiated with her.

But you need to know this...  Some of the beds do not come with a mattress. Please talk to your landlord about this. The landlord will install a TV in the living room. The shelves you see in Bedroom 1 will be assembled by the time you move in. And this...  The video only shows the first floor. The rest of the house is undergoing renovations at the moment. There will be a laundry room in the basement. This is still under construction. Your Home-checker, Anna, said:  \u201cI loved this property.

It\u2019s a bit like living in a student hall of residence because you share social spaces with your peers. But unlike a hall of residence, coliving spaces work to create happy individuals and healthy communities.  Living here, you\u2019ll get to meet people from all over the world. People with different stories, original perspectives, and shared values. You'll make friends, learn surprising lessons, and love the experience. Plus you get everything you need in one place More Information: homespace.website/yrot-nopromoted",

So I am posting here to find another mum preferably with a toddler or smaller child that is looking to get out of Berlin on the weekends, I offer free housing on the weekend in a beautiful vacation area. There is a beautiful horse farm, a bear park to see real wild bears and many other great activities for kids , beautiful public wellness baths for the mums, plus you can let your kids run safely in the nature and nothing happens. I'd be happy to connect with other mums and share my large home and make friends over the time . The goal is to me that my child speaks our native language English.   Also I am in Berlin 2 days per week at the moment if you want to connect !   You must have your own car to get here. Of course we should video chat first and see if this could be a good fit ? . Anyway this is only to make sure the kids keep speaking our native language English as well ( mine is speaking more German currently ) Thank you for your support, maybe we can support each other.

It is charming, small but hit by a bit of direct sunlight in the morning and has a tree in front of the window, - which gives an airy feeling in the 4th floor in the quiet backyard. And a hammock. The best case is that you are a plant-lover and willing to take care for the attempt to have some greenery in the city-flat and water the plants once a while.   The rent is 550 Euro / a month Since the 3rd month will be 10 days less reduced accordingly.  If you rent it as a couple + 30   (water boiler)  Please be ready to pay 100,- deposit, which will be paid back after the stay.    As it is a small, but a personal hideaway from a project-based life I'd prefer that if you are already in town to have a quick meeting and you see yourself if you like the place and would take care for the plants. But reach out anyways if you are somewhere in the distance.    Best regards.",

    "description": "Hello! My wife and I are a clean, young & professional couple moving to Berlin on June 1st, 06.01.20. We are looking for a one bedroom flat, either for short or long term rental (minimum one month). Open to sublets, but no roommates please! Furnished or unfurnished both fine. I work with the homeless and she is a bartender and phone operator, and we are looking to pay a maximum of 950 Euro/Month. We both also have jobs that we can do remotely, so we will already have a job moving to Berlin.  A little bit about us: Kaz (me): 24 years old, I am British but have been living in the states for the past ten years. I am a social worker, currently working with homeless families with children in Portland, Oregon. I used to live in Paris & I love live music and visual arts.  Regina (my wife): 26 years old, she is a bartender who is passionate about travel, community service work & discovering the outdoors. We like to go out sometimes, but we are by no means 'party animals', and both enjoy keeping a clean and organized flat.  Ideally looking in Mitte, Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain, Prenzlauer Berg or Neukolln, but open to other places as well. We have a cat, so the apartment must be pet friendly. If the apartment is open slightly earlier than June but we sound like a good fit, please still reach out as we are flexible with dates.",

The cost is 800\u20ac which includes all utility bills etc! This is at a discount to our airbnb listing which costs 650\u20ac per week. If you would like to rent it out for a shorter period during the timeframe then it might also be possible.  Hidden within a little cul-de-sac off Stargarder Stra\u00dfe in Prenzlauerberg is this gem of a home. The spacious south facing second floor flat overlooks a childrens playground and a church. The sun shines throughout the day lighting up the living room with natural light. There is a balcony also, perfect for warm summer evenings. It is very well connected with transport networks, with Sch\u00f6nhauser Allee just a two minute walk away which links the U-bahn, S-bahn and the tram service.  There is a fantastic selection of good and affordable restaurants in the area, with vietnamese, italian, greek and many others just on Stargarder Stra\u00dfe. There are also many cool bars and cafes to hang out at. Mauer Park is just a ten minute walk to the west where you will find the famous vintage flea market open on Sundays.  The flat itself is very spacious but warm and cosy and attention to detail and style is prominent from the kitchen through to the bedroom. There is a washing machine, fridge/freezer, hob/cooker tv, and an audio setup for music. The bedroom is large with a brand new queen size bed. Clean sheets and towels are provided. The bathroom has a shower and a bath tub! High-Speed Wi-Fi is available!  We really love our home and we only want to give it to someone who is caring and trustworthy. The flat is in a family orientated neighbourhood, therefore if you are looking for a party flat it is probably not the right one for you. Strictly no smoking inside, you can use the balcony.  if you have any queries please don't hesitate to get in touch.  p.s. The photos are actually a little outdated so the flat is looking much more homely with art on the walls and big vibrant cacti and plants. :)  Best,  Jim & Vick.",

    "description": "Renting out my beautiful flat in Wedding in a really nice neighborhood from March for minimum 4 months or longer.  This flat is situated in the up and coming borough of Wedding, historically a communist workers district which has recently been discovered by artists, designers and other young entrepreneurs.   You're really well connected here. With access to the S-Bahn ring, the underground, the tram and buses of course (U6, U9, M13) no place in Berlin is further than a 20 min journey. The nearest underground station (Nauener Platz) is on the same road and only a 5 min walk away. From here you can get to Mitte in about 10 minutes. The tram taking you directly through Prenzlauer Berg and to Friedrichshain's party areas is around the corner, a 2 min walk away. It's only 10 minutes by bus to the main railway station and you have a superb and fast connection to Tegel Airport!  The bright upper ground floor, 40 square meter flat consists of a living/ sleeping room, separate kitchen, bathroom, entrance area and a fantastic large private garden which looks out onto a preserved lightbulb factory.   All rooms have big windows and allow for plenty of light. Very high ceilings, coving elements make this a really pleasant place to base yourself in Berlin. The area is very beautiful, filled with many 19th century buildings, wide streets and gas lamp lined sidewalks which turn every night-time stroll into a romantic affair.   There are plenty of nice cafes, some bars and restaurants, which are always filled with life. Weddings Schillerpark is only a 5 min walk away and 5 min by bike you will get to the Rehberge which is a large urban woodland with a lake and sandy beach, perfect for the summer! It also hosts the open air summer cinema which I can highly recommend.   Everything you need is a maximum 5 min walk away. Busy and multi-cultural Muellerstrasse (128 nationalities live here!) is literally around the corner -- it's Wedding's main commercial street, filled with food shops, supermarkets, laundrettes etc. Also the derelict factory building which you can see from the garden has now been turned into a small commercial building where you can do your shopping, eat out, go to the gym or visit one of the galleries that just opened recently. Also there is a regular flea market on the tree & cafe lined church square just down the road.   As for the flat itself. . .   KITCHEN is equipped with stove/ oven, fridge, washing machine dining area with private views into the garden. We have also built a 'staircase' which now leads into the garden directly from the kitchen window. You can also access it via a door on the side of the flat though.   BATHROOM is very bright and has great garden with factory views directly from the shower. Both kitchen and bathroom are very private since the garden means you have no neighbours looking into your windows.   MAIN ROOM has several cosy areas, i.e. a floating high bed, a library and the sofa area. It's sunny in the afternoon and allows for a lay-in since the sun rises in the kitchen and bathroom.   HALLWAY has a large inbuilt wardrobe enough to hold plenty of clothes for 2 people and additional storage at the very top.   PRIVATE GARDEN is the best and my favourite bit. Especially in the summers, the factory walls which reach into the garden get overgrown with all kinds of beautiful plants and create a spectacular and peaceful backdrop.  For the garden enthusiasts, there is always something to look after, especially in the vegetable plots.   Rent includes all bills and internet for 990 EUR a month",

I am SUBLETTING my space from february (or march) - october or ONE YEAR. with the possibility i may give the lease over the person/not sure\u2026   I am in a very tricky situation in my life. I love my Berlin life\u2026 I do not want to leave and hopefully I can  save my space finding a GOOD, TRUSTING, DECENT QUIET FEMALE but right now, I have a family health emergency (which has been ongoing) and i have to be  away several months, maybe even a year\u2026 and i need someone  who will FIT IN here, hopefully speak german, and not bring too much attention to the fact i have to be away. Someone who doesnt\u2019 have furniture and someone who doesn\u2019t have an issue with SHARING the space if i need to come back !!  570 a month for a one bedroom, huge 72 qm space in Wedding near SEE STRASSE UBAHN, centrally located. small bathroom with shower, huge kitchen, and huge living room. There are 2 balconies. The apt is stunning, everyone loves the decor (antiques) You hear the birds in the morning, and if you want to start a garden on the balcony the landlord would love you!  The person who comes in here has to be easy to communicate with, respectful  of other people, CONSCIOUS, aware, and awake please and WORKING!!  This building is OLD SCHOOL, i.e. people live here for over 20 years, they don\u2019t care as long as there is quiet, and respect for each other\u2019s lives, so no coming in at 3 am, slamming doors etc.  Someone who enjoys the space as a sanctuary to come home to, to write, but  no parties. There are so many amazing YOGA spaces round here. There are green parks here and wonderful walking and Plotzensee is down the road. This area is NOT highly gentrified and still has a cool  old school german vibe to it. Speaking German would Help not req!!  So the ROOMMATE situation occurs MAY BE in jUNE / JULY when i have to come back for a few days or weeks. I am not sure. Because of the HEALTH issue I have to go day by day with my family situation!! I DO NOT KNOW.  You could end up having the space for one year for yourself\u2026 but i know i have to come back june or july just to show myself\u2026. so for a few days. But if things calm down in NY I may return for a few months so you have to be ok to share with me. I\u2019m a quiet, gay writer, i usually work nIGHTS, so it would help for the person to work 9-5 so each would have the space to themselves\u2026. the rent would go down to 380 a month\u2026   I\u2019m an older, but still funky dude girl writer! I like my space to think and write, but I\u2019m also super social and would love to share this space with a curious, but NO DRAMA person who likes her space too, but also likes to hang out with a coffee and chat  here and there\u2026.. Again, I repeat, there is a GOOD chance you could have this space for the whole time period on your own!!  Please email me a bit about yourself\u2026 i\u2019ll email photos!! And please please send me your NORMAL email (i always have some issues with the emails) PLEASE PLEASE GET IN TOUCH RIGHT AWAY\u2026 i\u2019m trying to get this sorted asap.. so as not to get stuck!! My place is now sublet til Feb 1  thanks and blessings and lets believe in miracles.. cause i sure need one now!",

    "description": "Hello All, I'm searching for a roommate for the month of February - with the possibility of extending until April 1st. The apartment is directly around the corner from Bergmannstr., with cafes, restaurants, and shopping right out the door. It is a super convenient walk to the U7 or U6. This neighborhood is well known for weekend markets, the Markthalle, and beautiful Victoria Park just a few blocks away.   I'm a middle-aged, clean and friendly vegetarian. I sleep on the floor in the living room area when I'm renting the room so I'm looking for someone who is ok with using one room and the kitchen. Both rooms have doors so we don't hear each other at night.   The apartment is furnished with everything you'll need for a happy stay. I've been renting on Airbnb the past month while working on my art business, which has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride. One sweet person would be a breath of fresh air.  The costs are \u20ac550 + \u20ac500 security for February. If we get along great, I can extend this. Registration is not included with this temporary rental.",

This is a quiet location close to the canal, the Treptower Park, the bars of Weserstr. or Kreuzberg. I don't wish for much noise or visitors in the time of your stay and I hope the place will feel like an Oasis to you and compensate for that limitation. The wooden floors, the furniture and all of the things you may use should be treated with a lot of care. There is a big desk, plants and a lot of space. I am looking for a respectful person, intending to use the space in a manner that will maintain the good relationships and simplicity existing. Most things here are of high quality materials. Please enjoy it, but keep it like you found it. A few personal possessions will remain in the room, but I will take care of them not being in your way too much.   The apartment has pretty much everything one needs, including a washing machine and a little balcony. I have made a negative experience while renting the room out once before, which is why I ask for the 650 Euros as a security deposit. In case everything will remain intact and especially the wooden surfaces won't receive additional scratches or damage through moisture, there need to be no worries for an easy and quick refund. I sleep on a thin mattress on top of high quality Tatami mats in a custom made frame, which I prefer to a regular bed, since I prefer to sleep on a bit harder grounds. If you prefer to sleep on softer beding, please bring your own additional padding, or even better: Mattress.   I am a sculptor and will work in the US for the time I will rent out my room. My roommate is easy going, very clean and kind. The sublet will not include an Anmeldung/Registration possibility. You will be my guest.",

    "description": "hi, i am offering my delightful home to a responsible person or couple or even family.  It is available for around two weeks from February 28th til March 15th 2020. The cost is 800\u20ac which includes all utility bills etc! This is at a discount to our airbnb listing which costs 650\u20ac per week.   Hidden within a little cul-de-sac off Stargarder Stra\u00dfe in Prenzlauerberg is this gem of a home. The spacious south facing second floor flat overlooks a childrens playground and a church. The sun shines throughout the day lighting up the living room with natural light. There is a balcony also, perfect for warm summer evenings. It is very well connected with transport networks, with Sch\u00f6nhauser Allee just a two minute walk away which links the U-bahn, S-bahn and the tram service.  There is a fantastic selection of good and affordable restaurants in the area, with vietnamese, italian, greek and many others just on Stargarder Stra\u00dfe. There are also many cool bars and cafes to hang out at. Mauer Park is just a ten minute walk to the west where you will find the famous vintage flea market open on Sundays.  The flat itself is very spacious but warm and cosy and attention to detail and style is prominent from the kitchen through to the bedroom. There is a washing machine, fridge/freezer, hob/cooker tv, and an audio setup for music. The bedroom is large with a brand new queen size bed. Clean sheets and towels are provided. The bathroom has a shower and a bath tub! High-Speed Wi-Fi is available!  We really love our home and we only want to give it to someone who is caring and trustworthy. The flat is in a family orientated neighbourhood, therefore if you are looking for a party flat it is probably not the right one for you. Strictly no smoking inside, you can use the balcony.  if you have any queries please don't hesitate to get in touch.  p.s. The photos are actually a little outdated so the flat is looking much more homely with art on the walls and big vibrant cacti and plants. :)  Best,  Jim & Vick.",

It has also a wardrobe big enough for all your clothes and then some. Also there's a drawers furniture for extra saving space. The heating is on the floor so it's always warm and nice to walk even barefoot  The apartment 5 minutes away from Ostbahnhof, Edeka is 20 meters away. Also in ostbahnhof there's penny and Rewe. Mariannenplatz is 20 on foot , Boxhagenerplatz is 25 min on foot. Plenty of fastfood and restaurants around, easy to access with the Sbahn, Ubahn and bus. its in the boarder of friedrichshain and kreuzburg and very practical for moving around with the bicycle or on foot. There's a parking at Edeka so very convenient for car sharing parking.  I'm in a transition phase, finishing my work until the end of January and then i'll be traveling for 4-6 weeks. So i won't be much in the flat and practically you'll be alone in the apartment most of the time. In 3-4 months also there's the possibility that i will leave completely the flat and if you would be interested you can take it over  Young professional 4 years in Berlin, i'm the CTO of a successful startup and i love technology, music, hanging out with a beer in the balcony and just chilling.

So what you see above may be a tiny, tiny bit different to what you actually rent.  And this...  The multi-use co-working space is to be shared with the neighbours in your building.

But unlike a hall of residence, coliving spaces work to create happy individuals and healthy communities.  Living here, you\u2019ll get to meet people from all over the world. People with different stories, original perspectives, and shared values. You'll make friends, learn surprising lessons, and love the experience.

The apartment is around 68 square meters and lays directly opposite the Elsen-Bridge in Friedrichshain. Next to the electro-club Salon zur Wilde Renate and the spacious Treptower Park, the Spree-island Stralau and the Rummelsburg bay. The S-Bahn station Treptower Park you can see from the balcony, it's a 4 minutes walk and the station Ostkreuz to the other side, is a quick 10 minutes walk. Beautiful place with high ceilings and big south-east windows facing and overlooking the Spree river and providing light and often bright sunlight all day long. my furniture is like in the attached pictures. Instead of a sofa I have a mattress and pillows on the floor of the licing room. The living room is big and the kitchen connects to the living room via old-style double doors. the bedroom lays towards the silent backyard of the building and a bath with shower and washing machine is there too. Warning: There is no internet/WiFi in my flat. I canceled it because it was always so shitty, that internet via my phone hotspot worked much faster. There's also the possibility to connect on a month-to-month tariff with a hotspot provided by German Telekom or if you decide to move in for a full year or longer, you can just make a contract with any provider you lik and choose; a router is still there. 2 supermarkets, Lidl and Netto, near by, a Sp\u00e4ti shop and an ATM right downstairs. The rent, all bills included is 850,00 Euros per month, and I'll take a deposit of 300 Euros, just in case you run away with my keys. Otherwise, you'll get it back guaranteed. Smoking, please, only on the balcony. I know it's cold, but ....  Happy to get to know you, speak soon. Cheers, Svenson  Location: The apartment is around 65 square meters and lays directly opposite the Elsen-Bridge in Friedrichshain.

Some are practise rooms for bands at the other side of the building\u2026   We are currently hosting viewings to fill the last rooms. The email address to organise this below.  We build high quality dedicated music spaces and offer long term contracts with options to share a space and cut the rent in half.

Since Kiss Your Ears already operates at less than half the price of any other on the market (they are dedicated to disrupting an unfair sector of the industry), that is quite the perk!

A beautiful and very large room (32m2) for rent in the heart of Kreuzberg (Wiener Str.) in a dream 200m2 flat with large kitchen and breakfast nook, living and dining room a large bathroom and guest toilet.  The room is tastefully furnished so you can move in as soon as you like. Bed, wardrobes, sofa, projector, desk, vanity... it's all there (see pics). You just need bring your personal belongings. The rent is 900 EUR and includes internet, electricity, heating, and all other amenities. There is a deposit to be paid upon moving in (1.5 times the rent = 1350 EUR). The room can be rented for short or long term but I would ask that you stay at least for 1 month. The room is available at least till the end of June 2020 but it is also possible to stay longer.   The apartment is located in the popular Wiener Str. in lively Kreuzberg. There are many bars, restaurants, cafes, and the full spectrum of nightlife Berlin has to offer within walking distance. Despite it being in the middle of everything, the flat is extremely quiet and peaceful as its windows all face to the courtyard. Goerlitzer Park is just across the street, there is a public swimming pool a stone\u2019s throw away, and the beautiful Landwehrkanal is only 5 min walk away as well. A number of supermarkets are just around the corner (Penny, LPG, Lidl, Aldi, EDEKA). The U1 stop is just down the street and the M29 stops close to the house as well. It can\u2019t get much more comfortable than that! With these connections you can get to Alexanderplatz, Hermannplatz and Warschauer Str. in no time at all.  You would share the flat with me. Given the size of the place, there is plenty of room for relaxed living. The flat is a clean and calm place. I am 33, an academic, love cooking, and enjoy a peaceful home with nice conversation. It would be lovely to sometimes eat together and enjoy a nice chat but you should be able to entertain yourself most of the time. ;)  For more info about the room/flat and more pictures, just get in touch!

I am SUBLETTING  my space from february (or march) - october or ONE YEAR. with the possibility i may give the lease over the person/not sure\u2026   I am in a very tricky situation in my life. I love my Berlin life\u2026 I do not want to leave and hopefully I can  save my space finding a GOOD, TRUSTING, DECENT QUIET FEMALE but right now, I have a family health emergency (which has been ongoing) and i have to be  away several months, maybe even a year\u2026 and i need someone  who will FIT IN here, hopefully speak german, and not bring too much attention to the fact i have to be away.  Someone who doesnt\u2019 have furniture and someone who doesn\u2019t have an issue with SHARING the space if i need to come back !!  570 a month for a one bedroom, huge 72 qm space in Wedding near SEE STRASSE UBAHN, centrally located.  small bathroom with shower, huge kitchen, and huge living room. There are 2 balconies.  The apt is stunning, everyone loves the decor (antiques) You hear the birds in the morning, and if you want to start a garden on the balcony the landlord would love you!  The person who comes in here has to be easy to communicate with, respectful  of other people, CONSCIOUS, aware, and awake please and WORKING!!  This building is OLD SCHOOL, i.e. people live here for over 20 years, they don\u2019t care as long as there is quiet, and respect for each other\u2019s lives, so no coming in at 3 am, slamming doors etc.   Someone who enjoys the space as a sanctuary to come home to, to write, but  no parties. There are so many amazing YOGA spaces round here.  There are green parks here and wonderful walking and Plotzensee is down the road.  This area is NOT highly gentrified and still has a cool  old school german vibe to it.  Speaking German would be highly needed!!  So the ROOMMATE situation occurs MAY BE in jUNE / JULY when i have to come back for a few days or weeks.  I am not sure.  Because of the HEALTH issue I have to go day by day with my family situation!!  I DO NOT KNOW.  You could end up having the space for one year for yourself\u2026 but i know i have to come back june or july just to show myself\u2026. so for a few days. But if things calm down in NY I may return for a few months so you have to be ok to share with me.  I\u2019m a quiet, gay writer,  i usually work nIGHTS, so it would help for the person to work 9-5 so each would have the space to themselves\u2026. the rent would go down to 380 a month\u2026   I\u2019m an older, but still funky dude girl writer!  I like my space to think and write, but I\u2019m also super social and would love to share this space with a curious, but NO DRAMA person who likes her space too, but also likes to hang out with a coffee and chat  here and there\u2026.. Again, I repeat, there is a GOOD chance you could have this space for the whole time period on your own!!  Please email me a bit about yourself\u2026 i\u2019ll email photos!! And please please send me your NORMAL email (i always have some issues with the emails) PLEASE PLEASE GET IN TOUCH RIGHT AWAY\u2026 i\u2019m trying to get this sorted asap.. so as not to get stuck!! My place is now sublet til Feb 1  thanks and blessings and lets believe in miracles.. cause i sure need one now!",

WE: Live between the Weserstra\u00dfe and the canal. There are a lot of clubs and bars in walking distance, but also a mall and some nice parks. It's close to the Ringbahn and underground, the bus is even closer.  WE: Live in a newer charming building. We have a well equipped kitchen with a fridge, stove, sink etc. and a bathroom with a shower. Of course you could use all of this. We're living on the second floor but we've got a elevator which is very practical for moving.  YOU: Could live in a 25 sm big room - starting on the 01.01.2020!
